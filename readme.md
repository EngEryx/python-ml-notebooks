## Python Machine Learning Notebooks
- These are my personal experiments. It is always good to sketch your thoughts as an ML Engineer who is handling   leadership/management, I created this doc, to help not forget what I most comfortable working on.
- (BEWARE!!!) They may contain code that is not up-to-standard or rather well refactored.
